2883 donors in original file donor_p_150610084030.jsonl


Select TCGA projects (to keep record that they've been removed):
	grep '"dcc_project_code": ".*\-US"' donor_p_150610084030.jsonl > TCGA_donors_926.jsonl


Select only ICGC (don't select the -US projects):
	grep -v '"dcc_project_code": ".*\-US"' donor_p_150610084030.jsonl > ICGC_donors_1957.jsonl


Select donors where Sanger *is* performed (ICGC only):
	grep '"is_sanger_variant_calling_performed": true' ICGC_donors_1957.jsonl > ICGC_sanger_true.jsonl
	1415 lines

Select donors where DKFZ *is* performed (ICGC only):
	grep '"is_dkfz_variant_calling_performed": true' ICGC_donors_1957.jsonl > ICGC_dkfz_true.jsonl
	127 lines (so 127 donors) (same when TCGA included)

	(For false, there are 2756 lines, and we can't find '"is_dkfz_variant_calling_performed": true' when we open it in VI. Also, the following command returns no results.)
grep '"is_dkfz_variant_calling_performed": false' ICGC_dkfz_true.jsonl)


Select donors where EMBL *is* performed on ICGC only:
	grep '"is_embl_variant_calling_performed": true' ICGC_donors_1957.jsonl > ICGC_embl_true.jsonl
	128 lines


Discrepancy between EMBL and DKFZ: Brian's advice: toss any where there aren't both. So: select EMBLs out of DKFZs:
	grep '"is_embl_variant_calling_performed": true' ICGC_dkfz_true.jsonl > ICGC_both_DKFZ_and_EMBL.jsonl
	126 lines


====================
Redo BWA

If a donor has "bwa_timing", then we know it ran bwa. Select ICGC donors that ran BWA
	grep bwa_timing ../ICGC_donors_1957.jsonl > ICGC_bwa_1721.jsonl
	1721 donors have the timing we're looking for. Noticed that some have download times of null so... count them separately?

[	Let's see how many there are with some null download times --> can't do it this way 'cos variant timing uses the same key
		grep '"download_timing_seconds": null' ICGC_bwa_1721.jsonl |wc -l
		917	<--	whoa.
		grep '"download_timing_seconds": 0' ICGC_bwa_1721.jsonl |wc -l
		16	<--	what. Investigate.
	Will have to process line by line
